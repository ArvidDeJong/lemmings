# Laravel Lemmings Easter Egg
I use the lemmings page to prove that I worked on a website.

By using the page as an easter egg, it is also not harmful to search engines.

## Install with composer
```
composer require darvis/lemmings
```

## Add to laravel config/app.php
```
/*
* Package Service Providers...
*/
.....
Darvis\Lemmings\Providers\DarvisLemmingsProvider::class,
```

## Use as
Just use /lemmings after your url
